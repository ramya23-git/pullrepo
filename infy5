The -d option will delete the branch only if it has already been pushed and merged with the
remote branch. Use -D instead if you want to force the branch to be deleted, even if it hasn't
been pushed or merged yet. The branch is now deleted locally.
Now all the things you have done is on your local system.
GIT MERGE:
Git merge is a command used in the Git version control system to combine changes from one
branch.
To merge: git merge branch_name 
GIT CHERRY-PICK:
Git cherry-pick is a command in Git that allows you to take a specific commit from one bran
and apply it to another branch. It's like picking a cherry (commit) from one branch and adding
it to another branch, allowing you to selectively copy individual commits without merging the
entire branch.
Command: git cherry-pick commit_i
